I want to build a simple, professional web platform that connects startup founders with service providers (accountants, lawyers, IT, marketing).

Constraints:
- No coding experience on my side
- Use plain HTML, minimal JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS for styling
- No React, no Next.js, no complex frameworks (for now)
- Clean, modern, startup-style UI

Please:
1. Create the overall site structure
2. Set up Tailwind CSS
3. Create these pages:
   - Homepage
   - Browse Providers page
   - Provider Profile page
   - Submit Your Service page
4. Use placeholder data for now
5. Keep everything simple and readable

Do NOT add:
- Login systems
- Payments
- Messaging
- Reviews

Explain briefly what each file/page does.
