I want to build a simple, professional web platform that connects startup founders with service providers (accountants, lawyers, IT, marketing).

Constraints:
- No coding experience on my side
- Use plain HTML, minimal JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS for styling
- No React, no Next.js, no complex frameworks (for now)
- Clean, modern, startup-style UI

Please:
1. Create the overall site structure
2. Set up Tailwind CSS
3. Create these pages:
   - Homepage
   - Browse Providers page
   - Provider Profile page
   - Submit Your Service page
4. Use placeholder data for now
5. Keep everything simple and readable

Do NOT add:
- Login systems
- Payments
- Messaging
- Reviews

Explain briefly what each file/page does.

Review this project as a senior product designer

Have the Provider Profile page to maximise trust and credibility.
Emphasise:
Who this provider is
What they specialise in
Who they are best suited for
Improve layout so key information is visible without scrolling too much.
Make the page feel professional, not promotional.
