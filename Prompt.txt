I want to build a Super Mario–style 2D platformer that runs in the browser.
I have ZERO coding experience.

Please do ALL of the following:

TECH STACK
- Use JavaScript + HTML
- Use the Kaboom.js game framework (latest CDN version)
- The game must run by opening index.html in a browser (no build tools)

GAME REQUIREMENTS (VERSION 1)
- A player character (simple rectangle is fine)
- Left / right movement using arrow keys
- Jumping using space bar
- Gravity (player falls when not on ground)
- Platforms the player can stand on
- Camera stays fixed
- One simple level

BEGINNER REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Comment EVERY section of code in plain English
- Explain what each block does
- Avoid advanced JavaScript patterns
- Use simple variable names
- Do NOT assume prior knowledge
- Structure the code so it’s easy to tweak jump height, speed, gravity

EXPLANATION
After generating the code:
1. Explain how the game loop works in simple terms
2. Explain how jumping works
3. Explain how gravity works
4. Tell me exactly which numbers I can change to:
   - Jump higher
   - Move faster
   - Fall slower

GOAL
I want a playable Mario-like game on my screen as fast as possible.
